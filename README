This is simple PHP script to stream XM radio via a standard MP3 stream.

It requires the use of lame/mplayer and fifo.  I don't think Windows supports 
fifos, but it should work on Linux and was developed on Mac OS 10.5.

To use:
Rename config.inc.dist.php to config.inc.php, and edit based on your 
configuration.
Put playlist.php somewhere that requires http authentication
Put xm_stream.php somewhere that doesn't require http auth.  This is protected 
by the key in config.inc.php

Example of use:

Go to http://example.com/playlist.php/47.m3u for Alt Nation (channel 47)

Commentary on design:

Some players don't like http authentication on the mp3 stream, so
that's why I chose it to be protected by a key instead of http authentication.

Some other players cache the streaming URL instead of the playlist URL, so
I couldn't used a one-use or time-based key.
